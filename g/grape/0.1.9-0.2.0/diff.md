-`GraPE`_ (*Graph Processing and Embedding*) is a fast graph processing and embedding library, designed to scale with big graphs and to run on both off-the-shelf laptop and desktop computers and High Performance Computing clusters of workstations.
+`GRAPE`_ (*Graph Representation leArning, Predictions and Evaluation*) is a fast graph processing and embedding library, designed to scale with big graphs and to run on both off-the-shelf laptop and desktop computers and High Performance Computing clusters of workstations.
 
-The library is written in *Rust* and *Python* programming languages, and has been developed by `AnacletoLAB <https://anacletolab.di.unimi.it/>`_ (Dept.of Computer Science of the University of Milan), in collaboration with the `Robinson Lab - Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine <https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-robinson-lab>`_ and with the `BBOP - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <http://www.berkeleybop.org/index.html>`_.
+The library is written in *Rust* and *Python* programming languages, and has been developed by `AnacletoLAB <https://anacletolab.di.unimi.it/>`_ (Dept. of Computer Science of the University of Milan), in collaboration with the `Robinson Lab - Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine <https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-robinson-lab>`_ and with the `BBOP - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <http://www.berkeleybop.org/index.html>`_.
 
-`GraPE`_ is composed of two main modules: `Ensmallen`_ (*ENabler  of  SMALL  runtimE  and  memory  Needs*) and `Embiggen`_ (*EMBeddInG  GENerator*), that run synergistically using parallel computation and efficient data structures.
+The library is composed of two main modules, `Ensmallen <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen>`_, which is the Rust/Python high-performance graph processing submodule, and `Embiggen <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/embiggen>`_, which is the Python Graph Representation learning, Prediction and Evaluation submodule.
 
-`Ensmallen`_ efficiently executes graph processing operations including large-scale first and second-order random walks, while
-`Embiggen`_ leverages the large amount of sampled random walks generated by `Ensmallen`_ by computing effective node and edge embeddings. 
-Beside being helpful for unsupervised exploratory analysis of graphs, the computed embeddings can be used for trainining any of the flexible neural models for edge and node label prediction, provided by `Embiggen`_ itself.
-
-The following figure shows the main relationships between `Ensmallen`_ and `Embiggen`_ modules:

-Installation of `GraPE`_
+Installation of `GRAPE`_
 ----------------------------------------------
-
-For most computers you can just download it using pip:
+As usual, just install it from PyPi by running:
 
 .. code:: shell
 
     pip install grape
-    
-Since Ensmallen is written in Rust, on PyPi we distribute pre-compiled packages for :code:`Windows, Linux, MacOs` for the Python version :code:`3.6+` for :code:`x86_64` and :code:`Arm` cpus.
-
-For the Linux binaries we follow the `Python's ManyLinux2010 (PEP 571) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/>`_ standard which requires libc version >= 2.12, this version was releasted in 03/08/2010 so any Linux System in the last ten years should be compatible. To check your current libc version you can run :code:`ldd --version`.
 
-These requirements were chosen to provide a good tradeoff between compatability and performance. 
-If your system is not compatible, you can `manually compile Ensmallen <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen/blob/master/bindings/python/README.md>`_ for any  Os, libc version, and CPU architecture (such as Arm, AArch64, RiscV, Mips) which are supported by Rust and LLVM. 
-Manually compiling Ensmallen might require around half an hour and 10GB of RAM, if you encounter any error during the installation and/or compilation feel free to open an Issue here on Github and we will help troubleshoot it.
+Generally, the installation does not take longer than a minute.
 
+It is possible to `manually compile Ensmallen <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for any OS, libc version, and CPU architecture (such as Arm, AArch64, RiscV, Mips) which are supported by Rust and LLVM. Just open an issue if you need some help.

 Tutorials
 ----------------------------------------------
-You can find tutorials covering various aspects of the GraPE library `here <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/tree/main/tutorials>`_. All tutorials are as self-contained as possible and can be immediately executed on COLAB.
-
-If you want to get quickly started, after having installed `GraPE`_ from Pypi as described above, you can try running the following example using the SkipGram embedding model on the Cora-graph:
-
-.. code:: python
-
-    from grape.datasets.linqs import Cora, get_words_data
-    from grape.embedders import SkipGramEnsmallen
-    from graph.edge_prediction import RandomForestEdgePrediction
-    from grape import GraphVisualizer
-
-    # Dowload, load up the graph and its node features
-    graph, _ = get_words_data(Cora())
-    
-    # Create the model
-    model = SkipGramEnsmallen()
-    node_embedding = model.fit_transform(graph).get_node_embedding_from_index(0)
-
-    # Visualize the obtained node embeddings
-    visualizer = GraphVisualizer(graph, node_embedding_method_name="SkipGram")
-    visualizer.fit_and_plot_all(node_embedding)
-    plt.show()
-
-
-You can `see a tutorial detailing the above script here <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/SkipGram_to_embed_Cora.ipynb>`_, and you `can run it on COLAB from here <https://colab.research.google.com/github/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/SkipGram_to_embed_Cora.ipynb>`_.

+On line documentation (currently being updated)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The on line documentation of the library is available `here <https://anacletolab.github.io/grape/index.html>`__.
 Since Ensmallen is written in Rust, and PyO3 (the crate we use for the Python bindings), `doesn't support typing <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/510>`_, the documentation is obtained generating an empty skeleton package. This allows to have a proper documentation but you won't be able to see the source-code in it.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-To aid working with the library, Grape provides an integrated recommender system meant to help you either to find a method or, if a method has been renamed for any reason, find its new name.
